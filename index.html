            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of 
            less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky 
            beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous 
            interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population 
            of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was 
            dominated by fishing or agriculture.
